---------------------------------------------------------

Running: 
--------
- If you are checking out the code for the first time, you'll have to install a `virtualenv` in the home directory of the project.
    - If you don't have `virtualenv` installed you'll first have to run `pip install virtualenv` to install it.
        - for more information on installing `pip`, please see: [http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html] (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)
    - Then at the base directory of the project run `virtualenv --no-site-packages venv` to install the necessary files.

- Entering the virtual enviornment: 
    - Execute the command `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment. 
    - To download the appropriate packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
    - Leave the virtual environment with the `deactivate` command at the home-level of the project.
